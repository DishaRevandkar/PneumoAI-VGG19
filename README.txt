-> To run the code:

1) Either the .ipynb file present in the zip folder can be run using Jupyter Notebook on local machine, or can be opened on Google Colab to run it faster with a GPU.
  
   Below is the same notebook file Google Colab link for viewing the results:
   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o3KS1cJtNAvEApeOJY0o0PIOFDUhgTeU?usp=sharing

2) The code expects the dataset folder 'chest_xray' to be present in Google Drive's 'MyDrive' folder. 
   For this, we first uploaded the dataset folder to drive and then fetched the dataset by connecting to Google Drive account.
   
   Below is the dataset folder Google Drive link for accessing the dataset:
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qlOvi2X57JPxK7cFaFTQEM-mExai9MAL?usp=share_link
   
   If the above link to access the dataset doesn't works, then the dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the below link:
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
   
   Note: The dataset will need to be imported to the Drive of the google account used, to run the project code.
